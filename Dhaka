	                              <p class="lead text-center ">Fortunately, the treatment for roundworms is safe, simple, and relatively inexpensive. The dead and dying roundworms pass into the stool after administration of the anthelmintic or deworming medication. Since none of these treatments will kill the immature forms of the worm or the migrating larvae, at least two or three treatments are needed. Treatments are typically done at two to three week intervals. Ideally, kittens are dewormed with each visit for booster vaccinations. If your adult cat goes outdoors, you may wish to administer periodic doses of a dewormer. Nursing females should be treated at the same time as their litter of kittens.</p>

	                                            <li class="lead text">Kittens should be dewormed as recommended by your veterinarian. The first deworming should be given at two to three weeks of age. Note that this is prior to the time most kittens are seen for first vaccines. It is entirely appropriate to present new kittens for an initial examination and deworming at two weeks of age.</li>
	                                            <li class="lead text">Adult cats remain at risk for re-infection with roundworms throughout their lives. Whenever roundworms are seen, the cat should be dewormed immediately. Cats at high risk for infection with roundworms should be routinely dewormed. Cats that like to hunt mice or indoor/outdoor cats should have a fecal examination several times a year.</li>
	                                            <li class="lead text">Many heartworm preventive products contain medications that will treat roundworm infections. This is the easiest and simplest method for preventing roundworms. Your veterinarian can advise you of the appropriate time to give these products, based on your specific geographical area.</li>

Roundworm eggs may remain viable in the environment for long periods unless they are exposed to direct sunlight or very dry conditions.</li>
